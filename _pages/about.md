I'm a first year Ph.D. student advised by Professor [Liangliang Nan](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/liangliang/) in 
[Understanding and modelling Urban environments in 3D](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/3duu/). I am mainly interested in 3D understanding and vision-based navigation topics. 
My doctoral research investigates learning-based 3D reconstruction and 3D urban scene understanding.
